  "CURRNENTLY:
   Items in AutoFocus are responsible for remembering/maintaining
   a certain amount of data:
   - The descriptive `:text` describing what the to-do item is.
   - The `:status` of the to-do item, which can be :new, :ready, or :done
      - Items are, by default, created with a status of :new
      - Once an item is deemed ready to do, its status changes from :new to :ready
      - Once an item has been focused on, its status changes from :ready to :done
   - After an item is added to a list, it gains a `:t-index` which indicates
     when it was added to the list.

   EVENTUALLY:
   Items in AutoFocus will remember:
   - when they were made, marked, and completed.
   - whether they were created as originals or as duplicates.

   As a result of the above points, it can be calculated:
   - for any given day which items were completed in that day.
   - how long it took for X items to go from creation to completion")

  - This function also maintains a consistent function API with
