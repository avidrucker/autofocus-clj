Day 24: Fix Hiccup rendering bug where vectors are passed in and
Hiccup renderer cannot handle them

Day 25: Implement scrollIntoView functionality into this document

Day 26: Start generating the data to render out document navigation
(jump links *and* headings)

Day 27: Render out a doc-nav heading and links with dummy data

Day 28: With the data in hand, render out one or more doc-nav headings
and links

Day 29: Give a crack at fixing the out of bounds error for
render-nav-widget function (as of D31, this hasn't yet been 'properly
fixed')

Day 30: Complete 'for now' the 'mostly good enough' rendering of 'most
of the desired' nav widgets, add project management & dev-task notes
to inactive code cells

Current: List focusing (mark priority ready item as done), then some
integration tests (see paper list)

Next: List reviewing

And Then?: Write down the application architecture in data, then
render diagram out to be made clear in a visual format

And Then??: To be determined...
